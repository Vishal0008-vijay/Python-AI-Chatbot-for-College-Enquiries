The AI Chatbot for College Enquiries is a Python-based conversational assistant designed to handle general questions and provide instant information about college-related topics. This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to build smart, interactive chatbots capable of simulating human-like conversations.

The chatbot can respond to common queries such as admissions, available courses, fee structure, hostel facilities, placement information, and contact details. It uses simple keyword matching and regular expressions to identify user intent and respond accordingly. The project runs entirely in the console, making it lightweight and beginner-friendly.

This chatbot is ideal for educational institutions looking to automate routine inquiries or for students and developers who want to understand the fundamentals of chatbot design in Python without relying on complex frameworks or APIs.
